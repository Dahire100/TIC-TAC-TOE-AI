## Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

**Welcome to our Tic-Tac-Toe game!**  
This project brings the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** to life, where you face off against an intelligent AI opponent. The AI uses advanced decision-making strategies to ensure you're always challenged!

---

### ðŸŒŸ **Features**
- **Dual Display**: The game is displayed both in the **terminal** and on a **2D graphical board**.
- **Smart AI**: The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**, making it nearly unbeatable.
- **Restart Anytime**: Draw or defeat? No problem! You can restart the game as many times as you like.

---

### ðŸ›  **Setup and Installation**
To play this game, you'll need to have **Python** installed, along with a couple of handy libraries.

1. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. Run the game script:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

---

### ðŸŽ® **How to Play**
- When the game starts, the **board** will look like this in the terminal:

  ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   4 | 5 | 6
   7 | 8 | 9
  ```

- **Make your move** by selecting a number from **1-9**. This corresponds to the cell you'd like to place your 'X'.

- After your move, the **AI** will automatically take its turn. Both the terminal and a **2D graphical view** will update to show the latest state of the game.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Gameplay Example**
1. Enter your move (e.g., `5` to place your 'X' in the center).
2. The AI will calculate its best move using the **Minimax Algorithm**.
3. The game continues until there's a **winner** or the board is full (a **draw**).
4. After each game, you'll have the chance to **restart** and play again!
